## Motivation:

- there is limited research about decentralization in Indonesia that has provided a conclusive answer on the regional income disparity dynamics.
- Scarce academic literature on convergence at the district level in Indonesia. 
  
## Research Question:
  
- **To what extent the role of space affects the convergence dynamics across Indonesian regions?**

## Methods:

- Classical convergence framework (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992)
and  Distributional convergence framework (Quah 1996; Hyndman et. al 1996)
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and differential Moran's I)
- Getis Filter (Getis 1995)



---
# Main Results

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the district level. 

2. **Distributional Convergence** 

  - For provinces, there are 4 convergence clubs.
  - For districts high mobility in the upper tail of the distribution.
  
3. **Filtered data ** 

  - High mobility on the filtered distribution.
  - Faster convergence speed for filtered data.
  
4. **Spatial effects**
  
  - Spatial effects are reducing the speed convergence of income at the district level.

5. **Policy Implication**

  - Increasing the effectiveness of local government's policies and coordination among regions.

# (1) Data
- The centroid coordinates of the capital cities of the districts.

<img src="figs/01_map_districs.PNG" style="width: 45%"  class="center" />

- A balanced dataset (districs interpolation). Income per capita for 34 provinces and 514 districts over the 2010-2017 period.

# (1) Introduction: 
##Decentralization to promote regional growth

- After the implementation of decentralization in 2000, the number of provinces and districts (cities and regencies) increased significantly.

- Local governments are granted a greater political autonomy and substantial responsibilities for administration and public services provision.

# (2) Spatial Autocorrelation : 

##Moran's I and Differential Moran's I

$$I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} z_i.z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2} = \frac{\sum_i (z_i \times \sum_j w_{ij} z_j)}{\sum_i z_i^2}.$$

- It captures the relationship of a variable in one location with the spatially weighted average of values at neighboring locations.

- The differential Moran's I is conducted to evaluate the robustness.

# Spatial Autocorrelation Moran's I 

- For provincial data the Moranâ€™s I statistic was **not statistically different from 0** for all years. 
- At the district level there are **Strong signs of positive spatial autocorrelation**
- The Moran's I is significant **for all years** from 2010-2017 and the differential Moran's I is significant from 2013

# (3) Spatial Filtering Perspective

<img src="figs/getis.PNG" style="width: 90%" />
 
- **A spatial filtering of the data can help us to avoid misguided interpretation**.

- Instead of using spatial regressions we can remove the spatial component of socio-economic variables and used t filtered data in regular regressions.

# (3) Distribution Dynamics Framework

# Intra-distribution dynamics

## Is the income ranking changing over time?

- Each  curve  refers to the income levels  at a given point in time 2010, 2013 and 2017.

- The lowest curve shows the cross-
section  of  regions  in 2010 in increasing  order (income ranking from the lowest to the highest)

# (4) Income dynamics for districts

- Low mobility in the bottom of the distribution, the relatively poor remain relatively poor...

- High mobility in the upper tail of the distribution

# (4) Income dynamics - provinces 

*Since Spatial autocorrelation is not significant for provinces just distributional and classical convergence analysis are reported.*

**There are at least 2 convergence clubs, 
two in the upper tail and 2 in the middle of the distribution**

# (5) Filtered income dynamics 

-  Distributional convergence and clusters for the **filtered income variable**
- The regions whit income over 20 times the average income un time t had income of just over 15 in time t+5

# (6) Concluding Remarks

## Inequality still matters  :

- Low mobility for the poorest districts and provinces.
- The convergence speed is below the standard in the regional literature for provinces. 
- Spatial effects are reducing the pace of convergence at the district level.

## Implications 

- To spatially filter regional income is important in order to avoid misleading interpretations.
- Call for better coordination of regional policies at the cluster level.
- Enhance inter-regional connectivity and cooperation. 
- Geography matters! breaking spatial barriers and the infrastructure and capabilities required for it must be on top of the policy agenda.
