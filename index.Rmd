## Motivation:

- there is limited research about decentralization in Indonesia that has provided a conclusive answer on the regional income disparity dynamics
- Scarce academic literature on convergence at the distric  level. 
  
## Research Question:
  
- To what extent the role of space affects the convergence dynamics across Indonesian regions?

  
## Methods:

- Classical convergence framework (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992)
and  Distributional convergence framework (Quah 1996; Hyndman et. al 1996)

- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and differential Moran's I)

- Getis Filter (Getis 1995)

# Main Results

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the district level. 

2. **Distributional Convergence** 

  - For provinces there are 4 convergence clubs
  - For districs high mobility in the upper tail of the distribution/
  
3. **Filtered data ** 

  - High mobility on the filtered distribution.
  - Faster convergence speed for fitlered data.
  
4. **Spatial effects**
  
  - Spatial effects are reducing the convergence of income at the distric level.

5. **Policy Implication**

  - Increasing the effectiveness of local government's policies and coordination among regions.

# (1) Introduction: 
##Decentralization to promote regional growth

- After the implentation of decentralization in 2000,the number of provinces and districts (cities and regencies) increased significantly.

- Local governments are granted a greater political autonomy and substantial resposibilities for administration and public services provision.

# (2) Spatial Autocorrelation : 

##Moran's I and Differential Moran's I

$$I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} z_i.z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2} = \frac{\sum_i (z_i \times \sum_j w_{ij} z_j)}{\sum_i z_i^2}.$$

- To capture the magnitudes of linear relationship of a variable in one location with spatially weighted average of values at neighboring locations.

- The differential Moran's I is conducted to evaluate the robustness.

# Spatial Autocorrelation Moran's I 

##"Strong signs of spatial autocorrelation"

<img src="figs/04_moran.PNG" style="width: 60%" />

**Moran's I is significant at districts level (p-value<0.01) for all years from 2010-2017**

**The differential Moran's I is significant from 2013**

# (3) Spatial Filtering Persepective

<img src="figs/getis.PNG" style="width: 90%" />
 
**A spatial filtering of the data can help us to avoid misguided interpretation**

**Instead of using spatial regressions we can remove the spatial component of socio-economic variables**

# (4) Income dynamics - provinces 

*Since Spatial autocorrelation is not significant for provinces just dutributional and classical convergence analysis are reported.*

**There are at least 2 convergence clubs, 
two in the upper tail and 2 in the middle of the distribution**

# (6) Concluding Remarks

## Inequality still matters  :

- Low mobility for the poorest districts and provinces
- The convergence speed is below the standard in the regional literature
- Spatial effects are reducing the pace of convergence 

## Implications 

- The spatially filtered regional income is important in order to avoid misleading interpretations.
- Call for better coordination of regional policies at the cluster level.
- Enhance interregional connectivity and cooperation.
